# Bangladesh Flood Management and Early Warning System Simulator

## Executive Summary

### Critical Problem Statement
Bangladesh faces catastrophic flooding that annually displaces nearly 700,000 people and affects 18 million during extreme events, with 30-70% of the country inundated each year. The 2024 floods alone caused 71 fatalities, stranded 582,155 families, and resulted in $121.6 million in fisheries losses and $34 million in livestock damage. Despite having over 5,000 multipurpose disaster shelters and an advanced Cyclone Preparedness Program with 76,000 volunteers, evacuation rates remain low and economic damages continue to escalate. This simulation addresses the urgent need for integrated flood forecasting, economic impact assessment, and evacuation optimization to enhance Bangladesh's world-leading disaster risk reduction capabilities.

### Simulation Objectives
Develop a comprehensive Python-based multi-agent simulation that integrates Bangladesh's complex river basin hydrology, economic vulnerability assessment, population displacement dynamics, and infrastructure resilience analysis. The system will model the effectiveness of different flood management strategies, optimize evacuation protocols, and provide cost-benefit analysis of protective infrastructure investments across Bangladesh's unique geographic and socio-economic landscape.
